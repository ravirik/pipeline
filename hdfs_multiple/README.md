Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the ingestion of data from a web API request and store it into HDFS, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up a Git repository to manage your code, and create a branch for your development work.
2. Define the web API endpoint you want to retrieve data from, and specify the parameters for your request.
3. Write a Python script to make the API request and retrieve the data. Use a Python package such as requests to simplify this process.
4. Write a second Python script to take the retrieved data and store it into HDFS. Use a Python package such as hdfs to interact with HDFS.
5. Set up a Jenkins or other continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool to automate the pipeline. Jenkins can be installed on a separate server or in a Docker container.
6. Define the stages of the pipeline in your Jenkinsfile. The stages could include:
 Building the Python scripts
 Running tests
 Deploying to a testing environment
 Deploying to a production environment
7. Set up the appropriate environment variables in Jenkins to connect to your web API and HDFS cluster.
8. Configure Jenkins to trigger your pipeline when there are changes in your Git repository. You can use a webhook to automatically trigger the pipeline when new code is pushed to the development branch.
9. Test your pipeline and make any necessary changes.

Here is some example code that might be included in the Python script to retrieve data from the web API:

pipeline_code1.py

And here is some example code that might be included in the Python script to store data in HDFS:

pipeline_code2.py

Note that this code is just an example and will need to be modified to fit your specific use case. In particular, you'll need to replace the url, params, and client variables with values that are appropriate for your web API and HDFS setup.
