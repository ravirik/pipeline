This code defines two functions, retrieve_data() and store_data_hdfs(), which are responsible for making the API request and storing the data in HDFS, respectively. These functions are then called from the main block of the code.

The program takes five arguments from the command line using the argparse module: api_url, api_param1, api_param2, hdfs_url, and hdfs_path. These parameters are then passed to the retrieve_data() and store_data_hdfs() functions as appropriate.
