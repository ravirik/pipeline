This code defines two functions, retrieve_data() and store_data_hdfs(), which are responsible for making the API request and storing the data in HDFS, respectively. These functions are then called from the main block of the code.

The program takes five arguments from the command line using the argparse module: api_url, api_param1, api_param2, hdfs_url, and hdfs_path. These parameters are then passed to the retrieve_data() and store_data_hdfs() functions as appropriate.

code 1

To run this program, you would execute it from the command line like so:

txt 

where program_name.py is the name of the file containing the code. For example:

txt 

This would retrieve data from the API endpoint http://api.example.com/data with parameters param1=value1 and param2=value2, and store it in HDFS at the path /data/example.json on the cluster at http://namenode:50070.
