code 

This code defines four functions: retrieve_data(), process_data(), send_to_kafka(), and store_data_hdfs(). These functions are responsible for retrieving data from the API, processing it, sending it to Kafka, and storing it in HDFS, respectively.

The retrieve_data() and process_data() functions are placeholders for the actual data retrieval and processing code that you would need to implement based on your use case.

The send_to_kafka() function uses the KafkaProducer class from the kafka package to send the processed data to a Kafka topic specified by the kafka_topic parameter.

The rest of the code is similar to the previous version, except that it now calls the send_to_kafka() function to send the data to Kafka before storing it in HDFS.

To run this program, you would execute it from the command line like so:
